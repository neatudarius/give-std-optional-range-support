Audience: Library Evolution

Description: The standard library lacks facilities for optional types when doing range operations. While other solutions proposed creating a new type, this paper explores the design alternative where `std::optional` is made into a range. 

> Note: This repo/paper is work for [WG21: C++ Standards Committee Papers](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/).
